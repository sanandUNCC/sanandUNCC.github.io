        <h3>Bad Website: <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale School of Arts</a></h3>
        <p class="center">Summary: This webpage was built for the Yale School of Arts program and its students.
            <br>It has many images and captions that display the multiple art projects made by students at the school.
        </p>
        <ul class="center">
            <li>C: The contrast is only in this website because there are opposing text colors against the background.
                <br> The background colors for each blocked element made readability a bit diffucult for some headings.
            </li>
            <li>R: This website has a varying color scheme such that there doesn't seem to be any continuity in font
                color and backgrounds.</li>
            <li>A: The elements of this page are all aligned to the left side and they only flow to each other through
                the grey bar that goes from the top to bottom of the page.</li>
            <li>P: All the elements in this website are relatively close together with almost no space to separate them.
                <br>It shoul seem that all the containers relate to each other but that is not the case so keeping them
                all together is a bad move.

        <h3>Good Website: <a href="https://supercoach.couriermail.com.au/nrl" target="_blank">SuperCoach Courier
                Mail</a></h3>
        <p class="center">Summary: This webpage was built for the NRL SuperCoach fantasy rugby competition that is
            sponsored by KFC. <br>
            It allows for the visitor to get caught up on the latest news and even sign up to be a part of the fantasy
            league journey.</p>
        <ul class="center">
            <li>C: The contrast between the dark fonts and light backgrounds allows for better readability for the
                viewer.
                <br> The shading behind the containers allows for them to be seen clearer against the background of the
                page.
            </li>
            <li>R: This page has a sense of continuitiy as it follows a single font for most if not all of its elements.
                <br> The color scheme for the whole webpage is white, green, black, and gold.
            </li>
            <li>A: This page's content for the most part, is centered while the extras are aligned to the right.
                <br>The elements flow easily as the center container has divisions that show different sections all
                related to the overarching topic.
            </li>
            <li>P: This website has all related topics in one container such they are in close proximity to each other.
                <br>This allows for there to be space between them and other containers that have other ideas.
            </li>
