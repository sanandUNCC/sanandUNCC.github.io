        <ul>
            <li>Personal Background: My name is Sai Anand. I am from Cary, NC which is a town that is 2.5 hrs away
                from Charlotte. I like playing basketball, badminton, and occasionally cricket. I enjoy a good book,
                long walks, and the Office.</li>
            <li>Professional Background: I currently have no professional work experience, but I am hoping for that to
                change in the future.
            </li>
            <li>Academic Background: I graduated from Green Hope High School in 2019 and I am now a Junior at UNCC and
                my major is in Computer Science with aminor in Cognitive Science. My concentration is Artificial
                Intelligence and Gaming.
            </li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows 10</li>
            <li>Courses I'm taking this year:
                <ul>
                    <li>ITCS 4156 Intro To Machine Learning: The field of Machine Learning is very important to the
                        development of AI and seeing as I wish to study that, I felt that this class would provide the
                        much-needed knowledge of the basics to do so.</li>
                    <li>ITCS 4230 Intro to Game Design and Development: Due to my concentration, I felt that this class
                        would benefit me greatly in the future.</li>
                    <li>ITIS 3135 Web App Design and Development: I was intrigued by the applications and the wide reach
                        that the area of web design had.</li>
                    <li>ITSC 3155 Software Engineering: To be completely honest, I chose to take this class because the
                        banner said that it was mandatory to do so.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Funny story to remember me by:
                I've got too many stories of me not remembering people's names so I just give them one and that's who
                they are... FOREVER.</li>
            <li>Graduating Year:
                2022 </li>
        </ul>
